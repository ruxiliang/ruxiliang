# The origin

The origin of the name Ruxi Liang is inspired by Haruhi Suzumiya,a fictional character introduced as the title character and heroine of the Japanese media franchise Haruhi Suzumiya. 

I got the idea from [this article](https://www.zhihu.com/question/267368457/answer/334813585) and transliterate haruhi into ruxi in chinese , and adopted liang as the family name.
